# flask-wireframe

A skeleton flask application to speed up development. The structure is commonly used and most projects will require these components.

Master branch includes database, database migrations, basic tests, and pages with bootstrap.

Feature branches contain different application features.

To implement a specific feature, set it up by creating a custom branch off of master, then merge from the desired feature into the new branch and it will be available.
